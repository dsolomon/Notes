Linked Lists
- all linked data structures share certain properties
* Each node in our data structure (here list) contains one or more data fields
(here item) that retain the data that we need to store.
* Each node contains a pointer field to at least one other node (here next).
This means that much of the space used in linked data structures has to be
devoted to pointers, not data.
* Finally, we need a pointer to the head of the structure, so we know where to
access it.

The three basic operations supported
by lists are searching, insertion, and deletion. In doubly-linked lists, each node points
both to its predecessor and its successor element. This simplifies certain operations
at a cost of an extra pointer field per node.

3-2
Write a program to reverse the direction of a given singly-linked list. In other
words, after the reversal all pointers should now point backwards. Your algorithm
should take linear time.

Problem Break Down:
Understanding the problem.
What does reversing the direction of a linked list mean?
What does reversal of all pointers to point backwards mean?
Do the pointers in a linked list normally point forward?
Can they point in other directions?

Linked List Break Down:
Linked list is a chain of values connected with pointers.
Have to create a class for the Node.
